Description: Provides several methods for computing the Quantile Treatment
    Effect (QTE) and Quantile Treatment Effect on the Treated (QTET). The main cases
    covered are (i) Treatment is randomly assigned, (ii) Treatment is as good as
    randomly assigned after conditioning on some covariates (also called conditional
    independence or selection on observables), (iii) Identification is based on a
    Difference in Differences assumption (several varieties are available in the
    package).
