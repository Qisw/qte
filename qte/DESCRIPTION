Description: Provides several methods to estimate quantile treatment effects.
    In the case where selection on observables holds (i.e. treatment is
    essentially random after controlling for some covariates), the user should
    use the method SoO.Qte that implements the method in Firpo (2007).  When
    treatment is random, the user can use the same method, but provide no
    covariates.  When the user has access to panel data, then they should use
    the method panelDiD.Qte.  Finally, when the user has access to an available
    instrumental variable, then they should use iv.Qte.
